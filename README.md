## 📖 Overview

This application allows users to upload a brain MRI scan and receive an instant prediction of one of four classes, along with a confidence score:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔴 Glioma | Tumor arising from glial cells |
| 🟠 Meningioma | Tumor arising from the meninges |
| 🟡 Pituitary Tumor | Tumor located in the pituitary gland |
| 🟢 No Tumor | No abnormality detected |

The project demonstrates a complete deep learning workflow — from dataset preprocessing and CNN training to deploying the trained model behind a Flask web interface.

> **Note:** This project was developed as a college project for educational and learning purposes.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Predictions are **not medically certified** and must **never** be used for real clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions. Always consult a qualified medical professional.

## 🧩 Model Architecture

The classifier is a custom Convolutional Neural Network trained on labeled brain MRI scans, using standard techniques for medical image classification:

- Convolution + ReLU + MaxPooling blocks for hierarchical feature extraction
- Batch normalization for stable, faster convergence
- Dropout layers to reduce overfitting
- Dense classification head with softmax output over 4 classes
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom) during training to improve generalization

Full architecture details, training curves, and evaluation metrics are available in `notebooks/01_brain_tumor_cnn.ipynb`.

> 💡 **Tip:** Add your actual accuracy / precision / recall / F1 numbers and a confusion matrix image here once available, e.g.:
>
> | Metric | Score |
> |--------|-------|
> | Accuracy | xx.x% |
> | Precision | xx.x% |
> | Recall | xx.x% |
> | F1-score | xx.x% |

## 📦 Download Pre-trained Model

GitHub enforces a **100 MB file size limit**, so the trained `.keras` model files are **not included** in this repository.

**📥 Download from Google Drive:**
👉 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10B6OCV832H0Jr5vBFptZ06ILJtCiJMWa?usp=drive_link

After downloading, place the model files inside:

```text
models/
├── best_brain_tumor_cnn.keras
└── brain_tumor_cnn_final.keras
```

Without these files, the web application will not be able to make predictions.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyam792/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

**Linux/macOS**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### 4. Download the Trained Model

Download the model files from the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10B6OCV832H0Jr5vBFptZ06ILJtCiJMWa?usp=drive_link) above and place them inside `models/`.

## 🏋️ Training the Model

To train the CNN model from scratch:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script handles:

- Dataset loading
- Image preprocessing
- Training
- Validation
- Model checkpointing
- Model evaluation
- Saving trained weights

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

Upload an MRI image and the application will return the predicted class along with a confidence score.

---

## 📒 Notebook

A complete, self-contained Jupyter Notebook is included, covering:

- Dataset preprocessing
- CNN architecture design
- Model training
- Validation
- Performance evaluation
